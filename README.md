# Adversarial-Dropout
Implementation of "Adversarial Dropout for Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning" by Sungrae Park, Jun-Keon Park, Su-Jin Shin and Il-Chul Moon <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03631">https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03631</a>

Most of the code is based on <a href="https://github.com/takerum/vat_tf">https://github.com/takerum/vat_tf</a>, I simply added Virtual Adversarial Dropout loss to it.
